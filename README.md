# UTRAINS : CI/CD for Spring Boot applications using GitHub Actions and AWS

## Lab Description.
In our company, we have a team of developers who have created a Java Application with the SpringBoot framework. The application in question allows to do the following actions: 

* Get random nations
* Get random currencies
* Get application version
* health check

So the company wants to operationalize and automate the development and deployment of this application.  As a student enrolled in the training courses at Utrains, the company would like your support to accomplish this mission.


The Team Lead of the developer team gives you the following information: 
1- We use __java 11.0.14__ to compile our SpringBoot application;
2- We use __Apache Maven 3.8.4__ to build the project
3- We use a __Github__ repository to manage the versioning of our source codes
4- We use Sonar to analyze and improve the quality of our source code
5- we use __JUnit 5__, a java framework for unit testing
6- To finish building our application, we want :
* as soon as the developers make a push on the main branch, the application is built, 
* the unit tests are executed, and if everything is correct,
* __sonar__ analysis is performed and the results on the quality of the code are recorded in __Sonarcloud.__
* a continuous deployment must be done on __Aws Elastic Beanstalk__

# Solution
## Notes: We are going to make these tasks for pedagogical purposes so that the student can improve it or use it as a project.

## The steps to carry out these tasks are : 
#### step 1: preparation of the environment
#### step 2 : GitHub Actions first Job (Unit Test)
#### step 3 : SonarCloud job
#### step 4 : Build job
#### step 5 : AWS Elastic Beanstalk Job
#### step 5 : Test RESTFULL services with Postman

# step 1: preparation of the environment
### goal : to have the source codes of the developers in a personal repository

- create a personal repository in GitHub. in my case I create the repository cicd_lab_springBoot

- clone your git repository in your machine locate. open the terminal and make these commands line.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:utrains/cicd_lab_springBoot.gitc
```

- enter the local github repository and copy the source codes of our SpringBoot application. these codes are in one of the Utrains server 
```sh
cd cicd_lab_springBoot
scp -r serge@unixtrainings.tk:/home/serge/SpringBootApp/* .
password: "please Prof. give the password to the students"
ls
```
with the ```ls``` command, you can see the content of the source code file in the image below. 
![SpringBoot App Content](./img_desciption/source_code_content.PNG)

The source code of the application on which you want to automate the CI/CD is currently in your local repository.

# step 2 : GitHub Actions first Job (Unit Test). 
We will now create our first Job. To do so, we need to create a yml file in the directory __(.github/workflows/build.yml)__ and then add the content below. For more understanding, read the comments in this file to understand the why and how. 

```sh
code .github/workflows/build.yml
```
#### Content of the file : .github/workflows/build.yml

```name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  #Manually trigger workflow runs
  workflow_dispatch:
  #Trigger the workflow on push from the main branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  #Test's job
  tests:
    name: Unit tests
    #Run on Ubuntu using the latest version
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    #Job's steps
    steps:
      #Check-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your workflow can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      #Set up JDK 11
      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v1
        with:
          java-version: '11'
      #Set up Maven cache
      - name: Cache Maven packages
        #This action allows caching dependencies and build outputs to improve workflow execution time.
        uses: actions/cache@v1
        with:
          path: ~/.m2
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-m2-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-m2
      #Run Tests
      - name: Run Tests
        run: mvn -B test
```
- In the above file, we have a pipeline called CI/CD Pipeline, it will be triggered manually or when it detects a push on the main branch.
- This pipeline contains a single job called testswith a name label Unit tests, this job contains several steps. 
- First, it will set up the JDK 11 then it will set up the maven cache and finally it will run the application tests.

### Now letâ€™s test our pipeline and see what will happen : commit and push your repository to GitHub.
```sh
git add --all
git commit -m "CI/CD pipeline : Test's Job"
git push origin main
```

* Now go to your Github repository and click on Actions. You will find the pipelineâ€™s status and the steps logs.

* We have circled in red in the pictures to show you how your first job works :

## 1. click on the repository in github then on the __Action__ tab to see the result.

![Action onglet](./img_desciption/pipeline_result_2.PNG)

## 2. click on the no of the pipeline to derive it;

![Test's Job](./img_desciption/pipeline_result_4.PNG)

## 3. click on the __Run Test__ step to see that the 5 tests in our source code have been executed soon;

![Test's Job Result](./img_desciption/pipeline_result_4.PNG)

### Cool, everything works fine ðŸ’ª.
You can also run the pipeline manually at any time ðŸ˜‰.

* Now letâ€™s move on to the next step in which we add sonar analysis to our pipeline ðŸ˜Ž.

# step 3 : SonarCloud job

- SonarCloud is the leading online service to catch Bugs and Security Vulnerabilities in your code repositories.

- in this step, we will click on the sonarcloud link, create an account if we don't have one already, then select our repository for some configuration. 

## 1. open the sonarcloud link by clicking  on this link

[SonarCloud.](https://sonarcloud.io/)

## 2. click on GitHub buton in this image.

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/sonar_1.PNG)

## 3. authorize Sonar to access your Github account, by clicking on the button below.

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/sonar_2.PNG)

## 4. click on __Import an organization from GitHub__ to create an organization in SonarCloud.

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/sonar_3.PNG)

## 5. Here, check in 1, in 2 click then select the deposit you have created. Then in 3 click on the __Install__ button to configure your repository.

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/sonar_4.PNG)

## 6. Enter your GitHub password and validate

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/sonar_5.PNG)

## 7. fill in a key for the organization then click on __continue__
![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/sonar_6.PNG)

## 8. select the free plan, then click on the __Create Organization__ button to create your sonar organization

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/sonar_7.PNG)

## 9. click on __Create New Project__.

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/sonar_8.PNG)

## 10. Select your deposit in 1 then in 2 click on the __Set Up__ button to configure it

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/sonar_9.PNG)

## 11. click in 1 to choose to configure __With GitHub Actions__

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/sonar_10.PNG)

## 12. We have the security information (token) that will allow GitHub to send the source code to SonarCloud for analysis. At this step, we will go to a tab where GitHub is located to put this information. Then we will return to this window and click on __continue__

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/sonar_11.PNG)

## 13. In GitHub, select your repository, click on the Setting tab. Select in 1 under the __Secrets__ tab the __Actions__ tab then in 2 to enter the sonarcloud token

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/sonar_12.PNG)

## 14. enter the name and value of the secret you have in your SonarCloud (step 12.)

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/sonar_13.PNG)

## 15. you can see the Secrets that you have created

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/sonar_14.PNG)

## 16. Return to the tab where Sonar Cloud is located, then click Continue. The window that appears gives a set of lines of code that we can add to our build.yml file to create a Job for Sonr analysis in our GitHub. 

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/sonar_15.PNG)

In this picture, the only line that concerns us is the last line marked in 4 :

## 17. creation of the Job for Sonar analysis:

replace the last line of this code below with your last line from the previous step. Then copy and add the code to your __build.yml__ file. 

```
############## SonarCloud Job ###############
  #Sonar's Job
  sonar:
    #Depends on test's job
    needs: tests
    name: SonarCloud analysis
    #Run on Ubuntu using the latest version
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    #Job's steps
    steps:
      #Check-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your workflow can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      #Set up JDK 11
      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v1
        with:
          java-version: '11'
      #Set up SonarCloud cache
      - name: Cache SonarCloud packages
        #This action allows caching dependencies and build outputs to improve workflow execution time.
        uses: actions/cache@v1
        with:
          path: ~/.sonar/cache
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-sonar
          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-sonar
      #Set up Maven cache
      - name: Cache Maven packages
        #This action allows caching dependencies and build outputs to improve workflow execution time.
        uses: actions/cache@v1
        with:
          path: ~/.m2
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-m2-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-m2
      #Analyze project with SonarCloud
      - name: Analyze with SonarCloud
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
        run: mvn -B verify org.sonarsource.scanner.maven:sonar-maven-plugin:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=utrains_cicd_lab_springBoot
```

## 18. update the pom.xml file.

open the __pom.xml__ file, then fill in the name of your project correctly in 2. Then in 2, put the name of your sonar organization that you have created in lower case.
![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/github_1.PNG)


- As you can see the sonar job depend on the tests job, which means once the testsjob fail the sonar job will not be executed.

### Now letâ€™s test our second Job and see what will happen : commit and push your repository to GitHub.
```sh
git add --all
git commit -m "CI/CD pipeline : SonarCloud's Job"
git push origin main
```

* Now go to your Github repository and click on Actions. You will find the pipelineâ€™s status and the steps logs.
![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/github_1.PNG)

## 19. goto SonarCloud then click on your project and check the result.

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/sonar_result.PNG)

### Cool, everything works fine ðŸ’ª.

After the unit test job and the sonar job, we will add another job to build our application and generate the jar file ðŸ˜€.

# step 4 : Build job

* This job will build the application using maven and will upload the jar file.
* The upload artifact step allows us to share data between jobs and store data once a workflow is complete. 
* In our case, we will use the uploaded jar file in the deploy job.

#### For this task, add the following code to our build.yml file

```
############################### Build Job and Generate the Jar File for Deployment ################
  #Build's job
  build:
    #Depends on sonar's job
    needs: sonar
    name: Build
    #Run on Ubuntu using the latest version
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      #Check-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your workflow can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      #Set up JDK 11
      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v1
        with:
          java-version: '11'
      #Set up Maven cache
      - name: Cache Maven packages
        #This action allows caching dependencies and build outputs to improve workflow execution time.
        uses: actions/cache@v1
        with:
          path: ~/.m2
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-m2-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-m2
      #Build the application using Maven
      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn -B package -DskipTests --file pom.xml
      #Build the application using Maven
      - name: Upload JAR
        #This uploads artifacts from your workflow allowing you to share data between jobs and store data once a workflow is complete.
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          #Set artifact name
          name: artifact
          #From this path
          path: target/data-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Now letâ€™s commit and push your repository to GitHub.

```sh
git add --all
git commit -m "CI/CD pipeline : Build Job to generate jar file for depoy"
git push origin main
```

* Now go to your Github repository and click on Actions. You will find the pipelineâ€™s status and the steps logs.
![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/build_1.PNG)

### The job has been completed ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ˜Ž.
You can even see the generated file in the artifacts part, you can also download it and run it on your local machine.

Now, letâ€™s move to the last step, which is the application deployment.
For the deployment, we are going to use AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

# step 5 : AWS Elastic Beanstalk Job

* AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services.

- With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those applications. 

- Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. 

- You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.

### Now letâ€™s create our deploy environment ðŸ˜Š : 
## 1. First, we need to connect to the AWS account then we select the Elastic Beanstalk service.

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/aws_1.PNG)

## 2. Then click on Create Application
Fill in the fields and click on create Application. 

In our case we are going to put:
-  Application name: spring-boot-deploy
- Platform: Java Corretto 11 V3.1.8
- Application code: sample application

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/aws_2.PNG)
Then click Create application.
The environment creation will take a few minutes 

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/aws_3.PNG)

 ## 3. Once the environment is ready it will look like this

- Here we can see the web link on which the application will be deployed.
![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/aws_4.PNG)

* Great, now we have an environment that is ready to use.
* As mentioned above, AWS gives us a public address to access our application from the internet.

[SpringBoot App public Address](http://springbootappcicd-env.eba-cpf23ppj.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

## 4. By default, the website will show you this.
![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/aws_5.PNG)

## 5. First, you need to add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID , AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY , AWS_SESSION_TOKEN to the GitHub secrets.

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/aws_6.PNG)
 
## 6. Now letâ€™s create the deploy job.

* this Job will allow us to retrieve the jar that we uploaded previously in our GitHub.

#### For this task, add the following code to our build.yml file

```
#Deploy's job
  deploy:
    #Depends on build's job
    needs: build
    name: Deploy
    #Run on Ubuntu using the latest version
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download JAR
        #Download the artifact which was uploaded in the build's job
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: artifact
      #Deploy the artifact (JAR) into AWS Beanstalk
      - name: Deploy to EB
        uses: einaregilsson/beanstalk-deploy@v13
        with:
          aws_access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws_secret_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws_session_token: ${{ secrets.AWS_SESSION_TOKEN }}
          use_existing_version_if_available: false
          application_name: spring-boot-deploy
          environment_name: Springbootdeploy-env
          version_label: ${{github.SHA}}
          region: us-east-1
          deployment_package: data-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
## 6. make add, commi then push the modifications

```sh
git add --all
git commit -m "CI/CD pipeline : Depoy app in aws "
git push origin main
```

- So, here, the job will download the jar file that was uploaded in the build job and deploy it to AWS EB.
- At this level, the pipeline fails because we do not have the privileges to generate the __AWS_SESSION_TOKEN__. 

![SonarCloud auth](./img_desciption/faill_1.PNG)

- if this step is done correctly, our application is well deployed in aws, and we can access it from the generate link in __Elastic Beanstalk__
